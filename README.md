# covid-19

It's like sandpit to trying to predict the number of infected people by COVID-19 using historical data. 



**Notebooks**:

- main.ipynb - Use all historical data and the function y(t)=a * exp(b * t).
- progress-fit.ipynb - Similar to previous notebook but use a few same type of functions to predict (omit last a few days to check how the trend is change).
